# UFOs

# Overview of the analysis:
  The purpose of this analysis was to get better acquainted with Javascript by learning the technical applications as it applies to data analytics. In this project we assisted Dana, a journalist writing an article about her hometown of McMinnville, Oregon. The city is apparently famous for UFO sightings over the last few decades. We helped Dana make use of a data file she received on UFO sightings by inserting it in a HTML page using Javascript.
   We created a table to organize the UFO data and then added the functionality to filter the data based on user imputed search criteria. This table in the HTML page acts as a nice bonus to Dana's article as it allows the readers to go through and actively engage with her content.

# Results:
  We were able to create a web page with a functional search filtering option. We have five criteria for narrowing down a search: date, city, state, country, and shape. The user will have to match at least one of the five criteria with the data provided to us by Dana for a result to appear. We included some images below that show the filtering mechanic in action.

# Summary:
  This webpage was a valuable addition to Dana's article, but it is not without its own drawbacks. The first being we are limited to the data provided to us in our data file. How cool would it be if we created a filtering option that filtered data that was scraped from a multitude of different sources. it would be challenging of course to get everything in the same format as our data file but not impossible. Another suggestion to improve how the html page would run would be implementing multiple pages for the filter results. If the total number of results increased too high it could slow down the page, we could also add an option to control how many results are listed per page.
